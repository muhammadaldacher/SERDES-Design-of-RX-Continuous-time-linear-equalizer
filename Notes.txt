- 	VDD = 1.2v is used instead of 1v:
	So we could improve headroom.
	
- 	RL need to be large enough to get considerable gain & to set the output DC level,
	(RL with the bias current set the output DC level)
	But Large RL reduces the headroom for the transistors & lowers the 2nd pole wp2.
	
-	Input transistors are biased to be in SAT, but close to Vth 
	to maximize the gm.
	
-	The 2nd pole (wp2 = 1/(RL*CL)) need to be pushed way higher
	than the dominant pole to allow peaking to occur.
	This can be done by:
		a) Reducing RL (but this impacts the gain)
		b) Reducing CL (but this depends on the loading from next stage)
		c) Add inductor in series with RL
